# Local Church

In-progress Node.js project for scraping & showing churches in the United States.

## Setup

Open `.env.example` and populate keys accordingly. Save as `.env`.

Run `yarn`.

This project uses [ESLint](http://eslint.org). Most editors can take
advantage of this with plugins to show errors inline.

## Running

There are currently 2 NPM Scripts:

- `scrape`
- `test`

## TODO

- [ ] This repo uses a data dump from
https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/forwardToPub78Download.do as its database. Figure
out a good system for user setup.
- [ ] Get Google Places API assisting data
- [ ] Display data on front-end
